# Milestone 1 - Proposal

## Overview

The US government is working on policy implementation in the United States to keep a control over the violent crimes mainly rape, homicides, assault and robbery. The officials are interested
in looking at how the crime situation has changed over last couple of years. Our Crime_buster_App aims to provide the trend of the number of crimes occurred in
the city of interest and over the time period selected by the user.

## Crime Data in hand

The crime data over the period of 40 years (1975 and 2015) has been complied by the Marshall project. The most serious crime incidents namely robbery, rape, assault and homicides from 68
police jurisdictions have been used for creating the Crime_buster_App. The source of the data is [Uniform Crime Reporting program's](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/series/57) 'Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest' database for the year in question, held at the National Archives of Criminal Justice Data. The incidents have been recorded per 100,000 residents per jurisdictions where the population data has been collected from FBI's estimated population for that year.

## Usage scenario & tasks

Bob works for the city of Chicago and is tasked to submit a proposal to reduce crime rate in the city. First Bob wants to explore how the occurrence of different crimes changed since the last policy implementation in 2010. When Bob opens the "Crime_buster_App", he will see a selection panel on the left side of the app where he can select data in specific interval of years, city, and type(s) of crimes. The first graph in the display panel will depict a time graph of crime occurrences over the years. Using the app, Bob finds that in the interval of 2010 - 2015, rape crimes increased while homicides decreased in the city of Chicago. He hypothesized that the last policy targeted towards homicides prevention more efficiently, but was insufficient in rape crime preventions. Hence, Bob decided to initialize an thorough investigation on rape crime prevention strategies for the next policy proposal.

## Description and sketch of Crime-Crime_buster_App

The landing page of the app will show 2(?) plots, showing the trends and patterns of crime occurrences throughout the years. From the selection panel, users can specific the time interval (in unit of years) and the state/city in which to show the time trend data for. Additionally, users can filter out variables by crime types in the selection panel. In the display panel, users can view the trends and patterns in different perspective by scrolling down through the app interface.
