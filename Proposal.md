## Section 1

## Section 2

## Section 3: Usage scenario & tasks

Bob works for the city of Chicago and is tasked to submit a proposal to reduce crime rate in the city. First Bob wants to explore how the occurrence of different crimes changed since the last policy implementation in 2010. When Bob opens the "Crime-fighter" app, he will see a selection panel on the left side of the app where he can select for the time interval in years, the city, and the type(s) of crimes. On the display panel, he will see a time graph of the number of crimes vs year. Bob first limits the data to his interested time interval, 2010 to 2015, then selects for his city of interest, Chicago. Bob finds that during the last five years, rape crimes increased while homicides decreased. He hypothesized that the last policy targeted towards homicides more efficiently, but was lacking in responding to rape crimes. Hence, Bob decided to conduct an investigation on strategies in the prevention of rape crimes.
